						<span>The day draweth nearer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And morrow ends our meeting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere they take thee sleeping</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be up⁠—away, my treasure!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Soft, leave her breasts all unheeded,</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>The sun all embraces dividing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>N’er grew pleasure all unimpeded,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>N’er was delight lest passion won,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to the wise man the fit occasion</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has not yet refused a full measure:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be up⁠—away, my treasure!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>If that my love thy bosom inflameth</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Be up⁠—away, my treasure!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Although thou with a sleep art wresting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis rightful thou bringst it close,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That of the favour one meeting shows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An hundred may hence be attesting.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis fitting too thou shouldst be mindful</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That the ease which we lose now, in kind, full</span>

					<span>Has fallen upon my garden.</span>

					<span>On the day when youth is no more upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will write of the leaves and the moon in a tree top!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will sing then the song, long in the making⁠—</span>
