<span class="i0">Until the great towers stood above the marshland<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wheeling beneath: the little creeks, the mallows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I picked as a boy, the Hackensack<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So quiet that seemed so broad formerly:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crawling trains, the cedar swamp on the one side—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All so old, so familiar—so new now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my marvelling eyes as we passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisible.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Eight days went by, eight days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Comforted by no nights, until finally:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âWould you behold yourself old, beloved?â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was pierced, yet I consented gladly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I knew it could not be otherwise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she—âBehold yourself old!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sustained in strength, wielding might in gript surges!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not bodying the sun in weak leaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But holding way over rockish men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fern free fingers on their little crags,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hollows, the new Atlas, to bear them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pride and for mockery! Behold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yourself old! winding with slow might—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vine among oaks—to the thin tops:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving the leafless leaved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bearing purple clusters! Behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_084" id="page_084"></a>{84}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yourself old! birds are behind you.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You are the wind coming that stills birds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shakes the leaves in booming polyphony—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow, winning high way amid the knocking<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of boughs, evenly crescendo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The din and bellow of the male wind!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leap then from forest into foam!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lash about from low into high flames<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tipping sound, the female chorus—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Linking all lions, all twitterings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make them nothing! Behold yourself old!â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I made to answer she continued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A little wistfully yet in a voice clear cut:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âGood is my over lip and evil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My underlip to you henceforth:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I have taken your soul between my two hands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this shall be as it is spoken.â<br /></span>

<span class="wandd">ST. JAMESâ GROVE</span>
<span class="i0">And so it came to that last day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, she leading by the hand, we went out<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Early in the morning, I heavy of heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I knew the novitiate was ended<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ecstasy was over, the life begun.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In my woolen shirt and the pale blue necktie<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My grandmother gave me, there I went<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the old queen right past the houses<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_085" id="page_085"></a>{85}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of my friends down the hill to the river<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As on any usual day, any errand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, walking under trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I went with her, she with me in her wild hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Santiago Grove and presently<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bent forward and knelt by the river,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Passaic, that filthy river.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there dabbling her mad hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She called me close beside her.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Raising the water then in the cupped palm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She bathed our brows wailing and laughing:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âRiver, we are old, you and I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are old and by bad luck, beggars.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the filth in our hair, our bodies stink!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old friend, here I have brought you<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The young soul you long asked of me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forth, river, and give me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old friend of my revels!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Give me the well-worn spirit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For here I have made a room for it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I will return to you forthwith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth you have long asked of me:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stand forth, river, and give me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old friend of my revels!â<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And the filthy Passaic consented!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she, leaping up with a fierce cry:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âEnter, youth, into this bulk!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enter, river, into this young man!â<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_086" id="page_086"></a>{86}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then the river began to enter my heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eddying back cool and limpid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the crystal beginning of its days.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But with the rebound it leaped forward:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Muddy, then black and shrunken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I felt the utter depth of its rottenness<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vile breadth of its degradation<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dropped down knowing this was me now.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she lifted me and the water took a new tide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Again into the older experiences,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so, backward and forward,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It tortured itself within me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until time had been washed finally under,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the river had found its level<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And its last motion had ceased<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I knew all—it became me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I knew this for double certain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For there, whitely, I saw myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being borne off under the water!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I could have shouted out in my agony<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the sight of myself departing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forever—but I bit back my despair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she had averted her eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which I knew well what she was thinking—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the last of me was taken.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then she, âBe mostly silent!â<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turning to the river, spoke again:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">âFor him and for me, river, the wandering,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But by you I leave for happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_087" id="page_087"></a>{87}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep foliage, the thickest beeches—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though elsewhere they are all dying—<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tallest oaks and yellow birches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That dip their leaves in you, mourning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As now I dip my hair, immemorial<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me, immemorial of him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Immemorial of these our promises!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here shall be a birdâs paradise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sing to you remembering my voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here the most secluded spaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For miles around, hallowed by a stench<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To be our joint solitude and temple;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In memory of this clear marriage<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the child I have brought you in the late years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Live, river, live in luxuriance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remembering this our son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In remembrance of me and my sorrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of the new wandering!â<br /></span>
